<h2>Shopping</h2>
<p>
    Spending your cash and ogling the latest designs is a great way to spend a Saturday afternoon,
     but surely you should be working out at the gym or doing 100 squats instead? Well, 
     although shopping isn’t the most strenuous of activities, it is in fact good for you.
     Shopping, according to a study published in the <b>Journal of Psychology and Marketing</b>,
     gives us much-needed mood boosts and was described as <b>‘overwhelmingly beneficial’</b> for our
     frame of mind by researchers.
